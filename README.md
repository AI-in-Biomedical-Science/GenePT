### What is GenePT?

`GenePT` is a single-cell foundation model that leverages ChatGPT embeddings to tackle gene-level and cell-level biology tasks. This project is motivated by the significant recent progress in using large-scale (e.g., tens of millions of cells) gene expression data to develop foundation models for single-cell biology. These models implicitly learn gene and cellular functions from the gene expression profiles, which requires extensive data curation and resource-intensive training. By contrast, GenePT offers a complementary approach by using NCBI text descriptions of individual genes with GPT-3.5 to generate gene embeddings. From there, GenePT generates single-cell embeddings in two ways: (i) by averaging the gene embeddings, weighted by each geneâ€™s expression level; or (ii) by creating a sentence embedding for each cell, using gene names ordered by the expression level. 

Without the need for dataset curation and additional pretraining, GenePT is efficient and easy to use. On many downstream tasks used to evaluate recent single-cell foundation models --- e.g., classifying gene properties and cell types --- GenePT achieves comparable, and often better, performance than Geneformer and other models. GenePT demonstrates that large language model embedding of literature is a simple and effective path for biological foundation models.

### How do I use GenePT?

The analysis scripts used to generate GenePT data and to reproduce the analysis in the paper can be found in the repo (with details for each script in the **Breakdown of analysis files** section below). 

We also provide the following list of readily-available datasets that might be useful for a broader range of applications:
1. Extracted summary texts scraped from the NCBI page for each gene.
2. Pre-computed GPT-3.5 embeddings (`text-embedding-ada-002`) for each gene.

### Tutorials and Use

We provide example notebooks to run the following analyses:
1. Gene-level prediction tasks
2. Gene-gene interaction analysis analysis
3. Cell-level biological data annotation 
4. Batch effect removal (Cardiomyocyte dataset; Aorta dataset)
